# ðŸ”— C Pointers â€“ Practice and Exploration

Welcome to this repository where Iâ€™m practicing and exploring **C pointers** through various simple to intermediate programs.

This is a personal learning space where I combine **pointers** with **arrays**, **strings**, and **dynamic memory allocation**. Iâ€™ve also included examples that highlight **common mistakes** like memory leaks and dangling pointers, so I can better understand and avoid them in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- Basics of pointers â€” declaration, initialization, dereferencing
- Pointer arithmetic and how it works with arrays
- Using pointers with strings and string manipulation
- Returning pointers from functions
- Double pointers and pointer to arrays
- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`
- Detecting and fixing memory leaks
- Common pitfalls like:
  - Using freed memory
  - Not freeing dynamically allocated memory
  - Dangling pointers
  - Uninitialized pointers

## ðŸ§ª Why This Repo Exists

Understanding pointers deeply is **essential in C**, especially when working on systems-level or embedded development. This repo serves as a hands-on notebook where I test logic, spot mistakes, and become more confident using pointers effectively and safely.
